## Overview
A Library Management System (LMS) is an integrated software application that manages the day-to-day operations of a library. The goal of such a system is to streamline library tasks such as cataloging, issuing, returning, and tracking books, magazines, and other resources. It also helps with user management, book availability, and borrowing limits

## Deployment

## Build your app

As of now, I haven't made any modifications to the database or connected it with the API due to a lack of knowledge. I plan to improve my understanding and build these connections in the future. I'll work on integrating the database with the API as I progress

## How It Works

### Prepare the Ingredients (Database Setup):

* Prisma Setup: Set up Prisma to connect to your database, defining your models for books, users, and admins.

* Environment Variables: Ensure correct variables like DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, and any API keys are set up in .env.

### Mix the Components (Backend/API Integration):

*NextAuth Integration: Set up secure authentication using NextAuth.js to manage user sessions and roles (admin, user).

* API Routes: Create API endpoints using Next.js API routes to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books and user data.

* Example: GET /api/admin/books for listing books, POST /api/user/borrow to borrow a book.

### Cook the App (Frontend Integration):

* Admin Dashboard: Create pages for admins to manage users and books.

* User Dashboard: Create pages for users to browse, borrow, and return books, with features like search and viewing borrowed books.

* Role-based Routing: Depending on whether the user is an admin or a regular user, route them to the appropriate dashboard or page.

### Serve the Dish (Deploy):

* Deployment on Vercel: Deploy the app to Vercel, ensuring environment variables are configured for production.

* Test End-to-End: Make sure the app is functioningâ€”users can log in, borrow/return books, and admins can manage content3
